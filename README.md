##**Warning?**

This is a **non-secure** site. I can only dream of being a _hacker_ or a _whistleblower_.

##**Work?**

I’m a **trader** who uses a **systematic and age-old price-based strategy** to trade the **currency markets** with positions that can last for **weeks, months or years**. It has been tested using decades of price data. I’m also working on expanding my trading portfolio across the futures and ETF markets. I coach new traders and may consider managing private funds if the opportunity arrives. My trades can be found at [Priceton News](https://priceton-news.github.io/priceton-news/).

My major business influences include great traders (Bill Dunn, Ed Seykota, Larry Hite, Richard Dennis, Jesse Livermore, Paul Tudor Jones, Jerry Parker, David Harding, Salem Abraham), Michael Covel, Robert Kiyosaki, Seth Godin, etc.

##**Who?**

Trading aside, I’m a professional family man who enjoys **washing dishes and dreams of braiding my daughters’ hair**. I **run distances and read regularly**. I believe in **natural food, natural body movement and natural healing**. I **don’t trust** the food & pharmaceutical industries, mainstream & social media, and politicians. I’m working towards **abandoning urban life** soon because I suspect I’m evolving into a caveman as the seconds tick.

I’ve lost touch with music and writing though I like them a lot. I had a music project that never took off and [a gibberish blog that cyber squats](http://doorsleftopen.wordpress.com/). I hope I can start writing again at [Medium](https://medium.com/@francisswt). I’ve also lost faith in football(or soccer) which is looking filthy with fake riches. Still, I keep myself abreast of Thai Football League, AFC Liverpool and Scarborough Athletic.

##**Where?**

I don’t trust gmail and whatsapp. If it’s necessary, write to me at francis@mrfrancistan.com or message me via Signal Private Messenger (if you have my number). Ok, ok, I can be found tweeting here too.
