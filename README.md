This is a [non-secure](https://www.eukhost.com/blog/webhosting/ssl-essential-now-google-warn-users-of-non-secure-websites/) site. I can only dream of being a [_hacker_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker) or a [_whistleblower_](https://edwardsnowden.com/).

## **./work**

I’m a [trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_(finance)) who uses a [systematic and age-old price-based strategy](https://www.trendfollowing.com/trend/) to trade the **currency markets** with positions that can last for **weeks, months or years**. It has been tested using decades of price data. I’m also working on expanding my trading portfolio across the futures and ETF markets. I coach new traders and may consider managing private funds if the opportunity arrives. My trades can be found at [**Priceton News**](https://priceton-news.github.io/priceton-news/).

My major business influences include great traders ([Bill Dunn](http://dunncapital.com/), [Ed Seykota](http://www.seykota.com/tribe/), [Larry Hite](https://www.trendfollowing.com/larry_hite/), [Richard Dennis](http://turtletrader.com/trader-dennis/), [Jesse Livermore](https://jesse-livermore.com/), [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.tudorfunds.com/), [Jerry Parker](http://www.chesapeakecapital.com/), [David Harding](https://www.wintoncapital.com/), [Salem Abraham](http://www.abrahamtrading.com/)), [Michael Covel](https://www.trendfollowing.com/), [Robert Kiyosaki](http://www.richdad.com/), [Seth Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/), etc.

## **./who**

Trading aside, I’m a **professional family** man who enjoys **washing dishes and dreams of braiding my daughters’ hair**. I **run distances and read regularly**. I believe in **natural food, natural body movement and natural healing**. I **DON'T TRUST** the _food & pharmaceutical industries, mainstream & social media_, and _politicians_. I’m working towards **abandoning urban life** soon because I suspect I’m evolving into a caveman as the seconds tick.

I’ve lost touch with music and writing though I like them a lot. I had a music project that never took off and [a gibberish blog that cyber squats](http://doorsleftopen.wordpress.com/). I hope I can start writing again at [Medium](https://medium.com/@mrfrancistan). I’ve also lost faith in football(or soccer) which is looking filthy with fake riches. Still, I keep myself abreast of [Thai Football League](https://twitter.com/thai_league), [AFC Liverpool](https://twitter.com/AFCLiverpool) and [Scarborough Athletic](https://twitter.com/safc).

## **./where**

I DON'T TRUST _gmail_ and _whatsapp_. If it’s necessary, write to me at [francis@mrfrancistan.com](mailto:francis@mrfrancistan.com) or message me via Signal Private Messenger (if you have my number). Ok, ok, I can be found tweeting [here](https://twitter.com/mrfrancistan) too.
